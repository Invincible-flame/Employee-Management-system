The success of my project will be guaranteed by these factors:
A login page that asks for username and password and verifies with all the passwords in the table USERS from the database “Employees.db”.
Sign up page that lets the user add their own unique password and allows access to the management system.
A intermediate page that lets the user select between the 3 main functional pages of the code (Salary Page, Leave Page and Attendance page)
The attendance page allows the user to input, update, and delete the id, name, gender, status and role and displays the output in a table.
The attendance page fetches the name of the employees to the salary page and provides a combobox to choose between all the id’s in the attendance page
The salary page has the features of inputting and updating salaries and displays the id and the salaries in a table,
The Leave page lets the user input the values of  id, date, starting date, ending date, total days, leave type, leave status in table leave and displays it in a table
Appropriate messages are displayed when an action is performed.
